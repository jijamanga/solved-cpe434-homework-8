 <li>If you wanted to store data on a disk in 512-byte blocks with the ability to detect 2 errors and correct 1 error how many extra bits would be required? Show your calculations.</li>

 <li>We have a disk drive with 3000 cylinders, which are numbered 0 to 2999. The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder 93, and the previous request was at cylinder 125. The queue of pending requests, in FIFO order, is: 45, 1950, 912, 1090, 130, 10, 2250, 130 Starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in cylinders) that the disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending requests, for each of the following disk-scheduling algorithms? FCFS SSTF SCAN LOOK C-SCAN</li>
